# SBT revolver plugin watches for code changes and continually runs your command:
$ sbt 
$ > ~test
# turnaround times as low as 2 seconds (one file change)

# Gradle can do it to, using "-t" option (incubating feature, may not be ready for prime time)
$ gradle -t test
# turnaround times average 6 seconds (one file change)
